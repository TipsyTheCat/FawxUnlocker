<h2>What this tool does</h2>
This tool recalculates the CRC32 checksum that Scrap Mechanic uses in the outfit unlock file.<br>
It does this by using an already uploaded fully unlocked unlock file.<br>
It takes your steam ID and applies the CRC32 checksum to the already existing file and makes it available to download.<br>
<b>So I repeat, this downloads a fully unlocked outfile file Vanilla + Fawx Garments</b>

<h2>What this tool doesn't do</h2>
You can not select which outfits to unlock, this will unlock them all (if some outfits are missing, tool may require update)

<h2>Credits</h2>

<b>Durf</b> - He figured out the CRC32 calculation and documented his findings allowing me to make this tool.
